# CSV Table

Csv Table converts any CSV file into an interative table that allows users to easily filter and sort their data.

## Getting Started

1. Fork or clone this repo to your local machine https://github.com/cdkirkwood/csv-converter
2. run `npm install-all` to load all needed dependencies
3. run `npm run dev`
4. The app should redirect you to http://localhost:3000/ to view the app. If you weren't redirected then you should go the that url manually.

## Built With

* [React] - Front-End Javascript Library for building the UI
* [Express] - Back-End Javascript Library for creating API routes
* [Papa Parse] - Javascript Library that parses CSV and converts it to JSON
